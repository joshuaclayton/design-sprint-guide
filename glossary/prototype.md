# {{ title }}

A prototype is a representation of a product with basic features used to test and validate ideas before launch. Prototypes can come in two flavors: Low-Fidelity ([wireframes](/glossary/wireframe)) or High-Fidelity ([mockups](/glossary/mockup)). Both can be used for testing at different stages of the product's lifecycle depending on the team's needs.
