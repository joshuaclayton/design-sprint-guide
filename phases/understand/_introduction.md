## Introduction

Phase one of the design sprint is about gathering all existing
information/knowledge on the business, the customer and the problem and
exposing our assumptions and knowledge gaps. From here can make plans to fill
the riskiest knowledge gaps and validate or invalidate our riskiest
assumptions.

Throughout Understand you should be working on defining the business, who is
going to be using the product, how this product is solving a problem that those
users have. What are the situations that users will be using the product or
feature? What are their motivations behind using it? What are any outside
motivators that might affect their use? The whole team should think about what
product success looks like and what success looks like for just the sprint. The
team should also talk about what they donâ€™t know, where knowledge gaps are for
the problem. As all of those are being defined assumptions that. The team
should cover existing research done before the sprint and review analysis of
competitive products.

At the end of Understand the team should have a well defined problem, a list of
questions to answer in the rest of the sprint, and a simple map or critical
path of the experience.
